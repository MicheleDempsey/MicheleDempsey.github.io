     Hello World!
     


My name is Michele Dempsey. I am a geometry teacher with 29 years of experience.  I was not an outstanding math student. In fact, geometry was my biggest challenge.  None of my friends predicted I would be a math teacher. I whined about math. Many of my students also complain about math.  It is too difficult.  My own struggles with math make me more understanding. I enjoy sharing my problem-solving strategies with others. I love watching people grow more confident. I will finish my degree in Educational Technology this summer.  I have no experience designing websites. Templates have helped me create websites in my other classes. I hope to learn how to customize a website for my students. Outside of class, I like running, cheeseburgers, and donuts. I also love to read by the beach.
