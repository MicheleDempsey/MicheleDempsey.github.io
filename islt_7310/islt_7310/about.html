<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>
My name is Michele Dempsey, and I have been teaching math for 29 years.  I have had the opportunity to teach almost every math course offered in high school.  My favorite course to teach is geometry. It is a challenging course for many students. I love to help students develop their reasoning skills and learn to problem solve. <br><br>I also enjoy helping other geometry teachers. I have been on the Geometry Curriculum Leadership team for four years.  Our team creates the pacing guide, formative assessments, and learning activities for our school district.  We also provided online learning activities when our school moved to distance learning last year.
