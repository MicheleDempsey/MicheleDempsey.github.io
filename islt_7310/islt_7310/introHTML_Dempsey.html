     Hello World!
     


My name is Michele Dempsey. I am a geometry teacher with 29 years of experience.  I was not an outstanding math student. In fact, geometry was my biggest challenge. Seeing me at a math convention left my high school geometry teacher speechless! I was not a confident student.  None of my friends predicted I would be a math teacher. I whined about math. Many of my students also complain about math.  It is too difficult.  My own struggles with math make me more empathetic and encouraging. I enjoy sharing my problem-solving strategies with others. I love watching people grow more confident.  Sometimes, students even learn to enjoy math.  Currently, I am finishing my degree in Educational Technology. I am learning how to use technology in my geometry class more effectively. I have created webpages in several other classes using templates. In this class, I hope to learn how to customize a website for my students. Outside of math class, I love running, cheeseburgers, and doughnuts.
