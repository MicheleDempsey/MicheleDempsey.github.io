     Hello World!
     
My name is Michele Dempsey. I am a math teacher with 29 years of experience.  I have had the opportunity to teach almost every math course offered in high school.  My favorite course to teach is geometry.  I have taught geometry exclusively for six years.  It is a challenging course for many students.  I love to help students develop their reasoning skills and learn to problem solve.  I also enjoy helping other geometry teachers.   I have been on the Geometry Curriculum Leadership team for four years.  Our team creates geometry resources for our school district.  Designing websites is a new endeavor.  I am excited about learning how to customize my websites.  I live in Aiken, South Carolina.  I am married and have one daughter.  She will graduate this spring with a degree in engineering.  When not teaching, I love to run.  I have also recently started taking spin classes. My happy place is by the beach with a novel.
