     Hello World!
     
My name is Michele Dempsey.  I am a geometry teacher with 29 years of experience.  I was not an outstanding math student.  In fact, geometry was my biggest challenge.  My high school geometry teacher saw me at a math convention.  She was shocked!  Many of my students complain about math.  It is too difficult.  My own struggles with math make me more empathetic and encouraging.  I have learned tricks and shortcuts.  I enjoy sharing my problem-solving strategies with others.  I love watching people grow more confident.  Sometimes, students even learn to enjoy math.  Currently, I am finishing my degree in Educational Technology.  I am learning how to use technology in my geometry class more effectively. I have created webpages in several other classes using templates.  In this class, I hope to learn how to customize a website for my students.  Outside of math class, I love running, cheeseburgers, and doughnuts.
