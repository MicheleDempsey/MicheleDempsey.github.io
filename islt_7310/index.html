<h2>Welcome Mustangs!</h2>

<p> Are you ready to learn how to use the Pythagorean Theorem? <br> Are you ready to learn about trigonometry? </p>

<p>The goal of this website is to help you learn how to use trigonometry and the Pythagorean Theorem to find missing measures in everyday situations.  We will begin with using the Pythagorean Theorem to find missing sides.  We will then learn how to use trigonometry to find missing side lengths and angle measures.  Lastly, you will learn to draw and label a right triangle that models a given situation.  You will then use trigonometric ratios or the Pythagorean Theorem to find missing measures.  This will take some practice!  The purpose of this website is to provide you with that practice.</p>


<p>1.	When given a right triangle with two known sides, students will find the third side using the Pythagorean Theorem.<br>
2.	When given a right triangle with one known angle and one known side, the students will find the length of a second side using trigonometric ratios.<br>
3.	When given a right triangle with two known sides, students will find the measure of one of the acute angles of the triangle using trigonometric ratios.<br>
4.	When given an angle of elevation problem, students will draw an appropriate diagram and use trigonometric ratios to find missing measures.
